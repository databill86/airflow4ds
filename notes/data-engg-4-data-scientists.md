# The Ugly Truth behind the Sexiest Job 

Thomas Davenport didn't start this fire, but he sure threw fuel on it with this [2012 HBR article](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). Big demand, short supply. Triggered a parade. Coursera, Udemy, EdX ... and Universities offering degrees. Bootcamps. Individual training. Hell, I used to be one. 

>  A data scientist’s capability to convert data into value is largely correlated with the **stage** of her company’s data infrastructure as well as how mature its data warehouse is. 

This means that a data scientist should know enough about data engineering to carefully evaluate how her skills are aligned with the stage and need of the company.

If you join a company where the lower rungs of the [DS Hierarchy of Needs pyramid](https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007) are not rich and robust, you probably will never get to doing the AI or ML stuff you dream about. You might have to first work with data-engineers and other infrastructure guys to build a healthy data pipeline that can power your BI and ML needs.

> Unfortunately, many companies do not realize that most of our existing data science training programs, academic or professional, tend to focus on the top of the pyramid knowledge. 

Many Data Scientists quickly become frustrated, and a few months later, they leave. The frustration is rooted in their limited understanding of how real life data projects actually work. They almost never receive tidy CSVs, and almost always need to write some SQL (or shell-scripts) and hack together an ETL pipeline before they can even run a univariate analysis of their data.



## Why?

- *“The Hiring Out-of-Order Problem”*
- *"The Experts vs. Generalists Problem"*

- *"Full Stack Data Scientists"*
  Luckily, just like how software engineering as a profession distinguishes front-end engineering, back-end engineering, and site reliability engineering, I predict that our field will be the same as it becomes more mature. The composition of talent will become more specialized over time, and those who have the skill and experience to build the foundations for **data products** will be on the rise.

## What is Data Engineering?

In a nutshell, this:

![etl-pipeline](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Uo56hrm9r5L_5fmPsY7I9A.png)

Data Engineers design, build, and maintain foundational *single-source-of-the-truth* **warehouses** and **pipelines** that enable data-teams to build and scale

- BI (Aggregation, Reporting, Visualization) applications, 
- A/B Testing Platforms, 
- AI and Data Science powered software products
