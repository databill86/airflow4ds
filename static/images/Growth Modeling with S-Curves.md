# Growth Modeling with S-Curves

A wide range of phenomena can be viewed as processes of stock depletion, including adoption of a technology by a market made up of a stock of consumers. Limited stocks place a ceiling on growth potential. Selling cars, mobile phones, watches, or computers will eventually slow down and reach a plateau after potential buyers have bought what they wanted and only get new stuff to replace the old.

Thus, to model such Growth processes, we need non-linear mathematical functions. The **Logistic Function** (aka sigmoid or S-curve) has been found to be well-adapted to describe such phenomena.  It is also called the [Gompertz curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function), after the mathematician who first discovered it in natural systems. It shows an *initial exponential growth* until the *inflection point* (or mid-point), and an *exponential decay* from then on until reaching the upper asymptote. 

$n_t = \dfrac{M}{1 + (\dfrac{M-n_0}{n_0})*e^{-ct}}$

- $M$: upper asymptote (saturation level or maximum capacity)
- $c$, the coefficient of growth
- $n_0$, the lower asymptote (initial value)
- $t$, time

The art of forecasting is to identify an S-curve pattern as it begins to emerge, well ahead of the inflection point. The tricky part of S-curves is that they inevitably invite us to focus on the inflection point and look to the left of the curve in hopes of identifying the inflection point’s inevitable precursors.

So what causes an inflection point, exactly? It could be a competitor releasing a superior product at a lower price point. There’s a drop in interest of your core product. Your advertising isn’t hitting the right audience. Maybe there’s a recession.

Regardless of the source, inflection points are a natural consequence of growth and the free market. Sooner or later, every organization will encounter internal and external factors that affect revenue creation and momentum.
